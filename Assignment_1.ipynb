    "Q1. values and expression\n",
    "\n",
    "*: expression\n",
    "'hello': variable\n",
    "-87.8: variable\n",
    "-: expression\n",
    "/: expression\n",
    "+: expression\n",
    "6: variable\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2. What is the difference between string and variable?\n",
    "\n",
    "Variable: A variable is a programming element used to define, store and perform operations. A variable can either be an integer, string, float, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "String: A string is a type of a variable. The value in a string variable is stored between quotes, either single or double. It is a data type for a sequence of characters. \n",
    "\n",
    "Q3. Describe three different data types.\n",
    "\n",
    "The 3 main data types are:\n",
    "1. Numeric: Data that has numeric value. Numeric value can be integer, float or complex number.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Sequence : Sequence is the ordered collection of similar or different data types. Sequence allows to store multiple values in an organized and efficient fashion. Sequence types are: string, list, tuple\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Boolean: Boolean objects are two types, True or False.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two other data types are:\n",
    "1. Set: It is an unordered collection of data type that is iterable, mutable and has no duplicate elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Dictionary: It is an unordered collection of data values. Dictionay holds key:value pair.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q4. What is an expression made up of? What do all expressions do?\n",
    "\n",
    "An expression is made up of values, variables, operators and calls to functions. \n",
    "\n",
    "All expressions evaluate a value. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q5. The assignment statements, like spam=10. What is the difference between and expression and statement?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Expression: An expression is a combination of symbols, like variables, constants, operators and calls to functions. It represents a value and is evaluated to produce the value. An expression must have atleast one operand (constant or variable) and have one or more operators. e.g x+7-5, \"a\"+\"b\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Statement: A statement does something but does not return a value. eg. assignment statements, conditional branching, loops, classes, import, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q6. After running the following code, what does the variable bacon contain?\n",
    "bacon=2\n",
    "bacon+1\n",
    "\n",
    "bacon will be equal to 22 only. i.e., bacon=22\n",
    "\n",
    "Q7. What should the values of the following two terms be?\n",
    "\n",
    "'spam'+'spamspam'= 'spamspamspam'\n",
    "'spam'*3= 'spamspamspam'\n",
    "\n",
    "Q8. Why is egg a valid variable name while 100 is invalid?\n",
    "\n",
    "In python number cannot be a variable therefore 100 is invlalid. egg starts with a letter and therefore is a valid variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q9. What three functions can be used to get the integer, floating-point number or string version of a value?\n",
    "\n",
    "integer= int()\n",
    "string= str()\n",
    "floating-point number= float()\n",
    "\n",
    "Q10. Why does this expression cause an error? How can you fix it?\n",
    "'I have eaten'+99+'burritos.'\n",
    "\n",
    "This expression causes an error because the addition operation is between string and integer values. The type of values should be same.\n",
    "\n",
    "It can be fixed by converting all the values to string.\n",
    "\n",
    "'I have eaten'+'99'+'burritos.'\n",
    "\n",
    "This will run to give: 'I have eaten 99 burritos.'\n"
